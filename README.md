# DPO-SampleEfficiency-Benchmarking

**Independent AI Research: Sani Jibo**

## Project Overview
This repository provides a minimal, clean implementation of the **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** loss function, built to facilitate research into **sample-efficient LLM alignment**.

The core focus is on moving beyond standard alignment benchmarks to **quantify the tangible cost reduction** that DPO offers over traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods. This is key to sustainable, large-scale LLM deployment.

### Key Features
* **Minimal DPO Loss:** Clear, easy-to-follow implementation of the DPO loss function structure.
* **Cost-Efficiency Metrics:** Includes scaffolding for measuring alignment epochs, data samples consumed, and GPU-hour reduction metrics.
* **Reproducibility:** Designed for quick setup to validate DPO's superior data efficiency and speed.
